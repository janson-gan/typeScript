    <h2>What is TypeScript?</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>A programming language which can use as an alternative to JavaScript.</li>
      <li>Is a superset of JavaScript whch means that it can expands the languge with additional features and syntax.</li>
      <li>Allow to use strict types which means that if variable declare data type as 'string' type, we can't just change the type later to a 'number' or 'boolean'.</li>
      <li>With strict types in place, error checking and debugging process becomes easier and code will be less error-prone. </li>
    </ol>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h2>How TypeScript Works?</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>As browser doesn't understand TypeScript in the same way they do JavaScript, so when writing TypeScript we have to compile it into JavaScript in order for the browser to understand.</li>
      <li>To use TypeScript, we need to install <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">node js</a> in our computer to install TypeScript.</li>
      <li>After installing node js, open up terminal and type 'npm install -g typescript' and press enter to start installing typescript.</li>
      <li>Open your ide editor and create a folder and with index.html and app.ts files. We are writing typescript code on app.ts.</li>
      <li>Typescript file should end with .ts extension</li>
      <li>In html file include a script tag pointing to app.js. Why app.js is because browser only recognise javascript file. If we point to app.ts and console log browser wouldn''t understand and it will not log result to console.</li>
      <li>In order to let browser understand typescript we need to compile app.ts to app.js by typing 'tsc app.ts' in the terminal. Once the command line is entered, typescript will automatically convert app.ts to app.js by producing another app file with .js extension.<li>
      <li>Now we can write some code and console log on app.ts, compile it and go to index.html browser, open up developer console and you will see the log. </li>
      <li>To save the hassel of keep typing 'tsc app.ts' to compile the file, we can type 'tsc app.ts -w' to set auto compile. '-w' means watch mode.</li>
    </ol>
  </div>
   <h2>Type Basics</h2>
  <h3>String | Number | Boolean</h3>
   <div>
     <p>
       The different between typescript and javascript is typescript uses strict types which javascript does not. For example we declare a variable with a string in typescript like the example below, and the variable will always be a string, we can't change it to a number or boolean or other data type else there wil be type error, we are only allow to change the string to other text.<br>
      <pre>
        let character = "Max";
        character = 50; //not allow
        character = true; // not allow
        character = "Volt"; // allow
       </pre>
     <pre>
        let age = 50;
        age = "Lucy"; //not allow
        age = false; // not allow
        age = 90; // allow
       </pre>
      <div>
       <pre>
        let isHungry = true;
        isHungry = 50; //not allow
        isHungry = "true"; // not allow
        isHungry = false; // allow
       </pre>

        </figure>
     </div>
     *  This concept apply to all other data types like number, boolean. If declare variable as number or boolean then we are not allow to change to other type, otherwise there will be type error.
     </P>
  </div>
  <h3>Array</h3>
  <div>
    <p>
      <pre>
        let user = ["Max", "Volt", "Lucy", "Sammy"];
        //add to array
        user.push("Leon"); //allow
        user.push(20); //not allow
        user.push(true) //not allow
        //change element
        user[0] = 50; //not allow
        user[1] = true; //not allow
        user[2] = "Bunny"; allow
      </pre>
    </p>
  <ul>
    <li>If initial declare array as string, then we are not allow to change or add different type of element into it. This goes the same to other types of arrays like number or boolean. </li>
  </ul>
  <pre>
    let numbers = [10, 20, 30];
    numbers.push(40); //allow
    numbers.push("50"); //not allow
    numbers.push(true); //now allow
  </pre>
  <ul>
    <li>If mixture of types are needed in the array we need to delcare in the initial stage.</li>
  </ul>
  <pre>
    let mixture = ["Max", 20, true]; 
    //All are allow
    mixture.push(60);
    mixture.push("Sammy");
    mixture.push(true);
    mixture[0] = false;
    mixture[1] = "Volt";
    mixture[2] = 15;
  </pre>
  <ul>
    <li>If we state at the start that it will only have one type, then it will only contain that one type in it.</li>
  </ul>
  </div>
  <h3>Object</h3>
  <div>
  <p>
    <pre>
      let character = {
        name: "Max",
        color: "Red",
        age: 10
      };
    </pre>
  <ul>
    <li>Propertie inside object work the same way as variables if declare as a string, number or boolean, we can't change that type.</li>
  </ul>
