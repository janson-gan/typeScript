    <h2>How TypeScript Works?</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>As browser doesn't understand TypeScript in the same way they do JavaScript, so when writing TypeScript we have to compile it into JavaScript in order for the browser to understand.</li>
      <li>To use TypeScript, we need to install <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">node js</a> in our computer to install TypeScript.</li>
      <li>After installing node js, open up terminal and type 'npm install -g typescript' and press enter to start installing typescript.</li>
